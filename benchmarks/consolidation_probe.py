"""Is there anything to consolidate in this vault? Measured before building, twice (#55, #54).

Consolidation — folding near-duplicate entries into one evidence-backed belief, hindsight-style — sounds
like the obvious next feature for a memory vault. On THIS corpus it has nothing to work on, and the
second measurement is the reason the answer is not merely "not much":

1. **Lexical:** exact duplicate summaries, then token-Jaccard clusters at several thresholds.
2. **Semantic:** pairwise cosine over the stored embeddings, split into "likely restatement" and
   "numbers differ on both sides" (a contradiction candidate).

What the second one exposed: 190 of the 206 high-similarity pairs came from a single 20-entry family of
*truncated identical prefixes* — the `'Corrected metadata for <topic> (agent: …, project_id:` class the
importer was producing before #54. So a similarity-driven consolidator would have spent its first pass
merging import damage, which is the opposite of what the corpus needed.
