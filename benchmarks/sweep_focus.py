"""Sweep query-shaping and focus-scoring variants (#48): does a blob stop winning?

The symptom: an entry that mentions every topic outranks a focused note for any single one of them.
Two candidate causes, measured separately because they get conflated:

  stopwords   the AND joins function words too ("which", "is", "the", "for", "this"), so a 4,000-word
              session report matches "everything" while a focused note that never wrote those words
              does not match at all.
  focus       bm25 rewards coverage, not concentration: hits spread through a huge body score like hits
              in a summary, so the ranking has no notion of "this entry is about that".

Every variant rides on the SHIPPED `quipu.index.search` — the stopword variant rewrites the query text
(the module tokenises it the same way), the focus variant re-scores the shipped ranking's own candidate
window. Nothing here reimplements retrieval, so "shipped" in the table is the code an agent runs.
