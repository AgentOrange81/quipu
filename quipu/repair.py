"""`quipu repair` — fix imported notes whose summary still carries its YAML quotes (#58, from #54).

The importer read frontmatter line-by-line, so a summary written as a single-quoted YAML scalar arrived
with its quotes attached and cut off at the wrap. The parser is fixed now, but a repaired parser does not
repair a vault: 88 notes on this box still carry a mangled handle, and until they are rewritten every
ranking feature silently works on the wrong text.

Two sources, in this order, because neither alone covers the corpus:

1. **The fabric origin, by frontmatter `id`** (not by filename — fabric names files by slug and suffix,
   while `id:` in the frontmatter is the id quipu kept). 74 of 88 here.
2. **The entry's own body**, whose first H1 line is a copy of the summary the import duplicated. 14 here.

Nothing is deleted, nothing is renamed: the file keeps its path, and only the `summary` line plus the
verbatim copies of the old summary in the body are replaced. A note whose source cannot be found is
reported and left exactly as it is — a repair that guesses is worse than a note that stays wrong until a
human looks at it.
