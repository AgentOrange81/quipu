"""`quipu ask-backfill` — the field that makes an entry trainable (#27).

`ask` is the question a searcher would ask; without it an entry is recall only and `quipu export` has no
pair to build. Only 17 of 864 entries had one. This is the only place quipu calls a model, so the tests are
about the guard rails around that call rather than the call itself: every answer is validated before it is
stored, the write never renames a note, and a dry run touches nothing.

The model is never contacted here — `ask_for` is patched — so the suite stays hermetic and offline.
