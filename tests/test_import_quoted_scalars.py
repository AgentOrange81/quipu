"""Fabric frontmatter: single-quoted and folded scalars (#54).

Fabric's own writer emits summaries as YAML **single-quoted** scalars and wraps long ones onto a second
line. The importer was line-based and only understood `"…"` and `[…]`, so every such summary arrived
with its opening quote still attached and cut off at the wrap.

That is not cosmetic. Measured on the live vault: 88 entries carry a leading quote (50 promoted), and the
20-entry `'Corrected metadata for <topic> (agent: …, project_id:` family — one truncated identical prefix
— supplied 190 of the 206 high-similarity pairs in a semantic sweep. Any similarity-based feature would
have clustered that damage first.

These tests drive the parser through `_split_frontmatter`, the surface a real import uses, and then a
full `import_fabric` run to prove the whole path comes out clean.
