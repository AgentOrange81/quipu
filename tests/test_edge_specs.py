"""An edge spec the replay cannot assert must be reported by `audit`, not only by `reindex` (#98).

`reindex` prints one skip line per spec it cannot assert and keeps going — correct, a broken claim
must not cost the memory. `audit` then called the vault clean, because its predicate check reads the
`edges` TABLE and a skipped spec never reaches a row. On the live vault that is three assertions an
operator wrote, unqueryable, with the reporting surface silent about them:

    wraith:kernel-7.0.0-43:required:nvidia-driver-615-open   <- four parts, silently re-shaped
    75771220:supported_by:this                                <- predicate outside the vocabulary
    ee066f78:extends:1ffca549986a4928b3                        <- same

The four-part one is the nastier shape: `split(":", 2)` shoves the remainder into `dst`, so
`s:kernel-7.0.0-43:required:driver` parses "fine" as src=s, predicate=kernel-7.0.0-43,
dst=required:driver — a spec that means something nobody wrote, and that no writer can re-emit.

Fixtures are RAW markdown, never `write_entry` output: the store rewrites the frontmatter on the way
in, so a fixture built through the writer cannot reproduce the file an older version left behind.

QA scope: tests/ only — the builder owns quipu/**.
