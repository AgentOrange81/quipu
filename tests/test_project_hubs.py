"""A project hub is a view over the tag, not 466 persisted edges (#85).

The measurement that filed the issue: 891 entries, 3 edges, 466 entries carrying a real project tag.
The obvious fill — one `part_of` edge per tagged entry — would mean writing 466 edge specs into 466
markdown files, and then `graph.rebuild` (which folds db edges back into the markdown) would keep
rewriting them on every reindex. The tag already IS the assertion and it is already in the markdown.

So the hub is derived at read time. These tests pin the two things that could go wrong with a derived
view: that it stays honest (identity matching, no `unknown` hub) and that it writes nothing.
