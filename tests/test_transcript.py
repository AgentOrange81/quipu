"""Acceptance gate for the transcript loader and chunker (cipher's transcript-chunking branch).

Black-box contract tests, written against the CONTRACT — `quipu.promote.load_transcript`,
`quipu.promote.chunk_transcript`, and `quipu reflect --max-chars N` — never against an
implementation. On main (a6f305c) none of it exists yet: these tests fail there on purpose, and
they are the gate cipher's PR must satisfy.

Contract, from the task: `load_transcript(path_or_text)` renders Hermes session JSONL (role/content,
where content is a string or a list of text parts) as `role: text` lines, passes plain markdown
through, and skips malformed lines without dying. `chunk_transcript(text, max_chars=24000)` splits
on turn boundaries only, keeps a single oversized turn whole, and treats max_chars <= 0 as no
chunking. `quipu reflect` against a dead endpoint must fail loudly: non-zero exit and an error that
names the endpoint URL.

Deterministic: tmp files only, no network access to real services, ports that refuse instantly, no
sleeps anywhere.
