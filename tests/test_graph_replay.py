"""`rm .quipu/index.db` + `quipu reindex` reproduces the graph from the markdown (#24).

The claim under test: edges and closed windows live in the entries' frontmatter (`edges:` /
`edge_closures:`), and the reindex path folds the db-only leftovers into the entries, clears the
db and replays it — so a deleted index.db loses nothing. This suite pins that invariant so it
cannot silently become false again.

Determinism: every instant a comparison depends on is either passed explicitly (`at=`) or read
from the markdown; nothing is compared against the wall clock. One fresh tmp vault per test.
Comparisons are NORMALISED structures (sorted tuples, edge ids excluded) so map ordering and
edge-id reassignment cannot make a test pass or fail by luck.

QA scope: tests/ only. The #24 code lives on fix/graph-truth; behaviour on this branch may be a
step behind — a failing test is a finding, reported with its real output and not weakened. Two
findings are ENCODED as strict xfails (marked with the issue trace): they pass while the defect
stands and red-flag the moment quipu/ makes the assertion hold.
