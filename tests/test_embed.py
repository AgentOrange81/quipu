"""Optional semantic retrieval (#5): storage, fusion and the degradation path — no network.

The embedding endpoint is injected as a `transport`, so these tests never leave the process: a fake
transport returns a deterministic vector derived from the text's words, which is enough to test the
ranking, the fusion and the plumbing without an embedding model on the runner.

What is pinned:
  - vectors round-trip through the disposable index and a re-embed skips unchanged entries;
  - a hybrid search returns fused rows whose metadata comes from the entries table (a vector-only hit
    the lexical ranking never saw must still print its summary);
  - with no vectors, or with no endpoint, hybrid DEGRADES to the lexical ranking and says why —
    it must never fail, and never silently pretend to be semantic;
  - the fusion weights what was measured: the lexical ranking still owns exact-phrase queries.
