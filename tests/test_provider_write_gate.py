"""The promotion gate behind the write tool (#79).

`quipu_write` used to go through `quipu.mcp._write` with no `state` and no `importance`, so an entry an
agent wrote was always `raw` — present and searchable, but never promotable and never exported as
training data. The fix has to expose both fields *without* handing the model a way to mint `promoted`
entries, so the same gate the importer and `quipu promote` use decides: evidence **and** importance at
or above the vault's `promote_threshold`.
