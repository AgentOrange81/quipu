"""The boot page and the capture limit (#51) — both are about what an agent can hold at once.

`quipu brief` is the standing answer: promoted entries, one line each, bounded by default because a
289-entry brief renders 20k tokens and a boot page that large is not a boot page. The size limit on
`summary` is the other half: a blob written today is a blob ranked badly for the rest of the vault's life,
and the measured failures of October were all of that class, so the writing is where it gets stopped.

Everything here drives the CLI or the MCP handler — the surfaces an agent uses — not internals. The one
exception is `write_entry`, and it is the point: importers must keep working on historical notes.
