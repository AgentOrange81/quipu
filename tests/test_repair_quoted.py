"""`quipu repair` — rewriting the 88 quoted summaries without breaking anything (#58, from #54).

The repair has two properties worth more than its output: it never guesses, and it never renames. A note
whose source cannot be found is reported and left alone, because a repaired parser does not repair a
vault and a wrong summary is worse than a quoted one. Nothing here touches the index until the notes are
written, and the write is in place — the file keeps its path, so no duplicate appears under a new slug.
