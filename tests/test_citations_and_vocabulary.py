"""Citations are a view, and an off-vocabulary predicate is a finding (#85, option 2).

Option 2 of #85 was `mentions` edges for the 117 resolvable id-pairs on the live vault. A citation is
reproducible from the body that makes it — `[[e2314ae5]]` in prose stays true forever — so persisting
it would duplicate a derivable fact into markdown that `rebuild` then re-folds. Same reasoning as the
project hub, so the same shape: derived at read time, nothing written.

The audit rule is the other half: the vocabulary is closed per vault (`.quipu/config.toml` can extend
it, which is how the live vault legitimately carries `served_by`), and until now nothing reported an edge
whose predicate is in neither place — a graph rots into 400 spellings of "uses" quietly.
