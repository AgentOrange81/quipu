"""Retrieval ranks where the match lands, and a thin AND result is topped up (#31, #43).

Two defects, one code path:

#31  bm25 scores a match wherever it lands, so a note whose BODY contains the query words tied with —
     and on a short body beat — the note whose SUMMARY is the claim. The fixture in the first test is
     taken from a measured case: with unweighted columns the body note wins (-9.34 against -8.43),
     with the shipped weights the summary note wins by 6.6 (-13.09 against -6.51).

#43  Every token is ANDed and the OR fallback only ran on an EMPTY result, so one rare token in one
     unrelated note produced a one-row answer that looked complete.

The tests assert ORDER and COMPLETENESS, not exact scores: bm25 magnitudes depend on corpus size, and
a test that pins them breaks the moment the corpus fixture grows. The corpus is padded to 32 notes so
term frequency is meaningful — in a three-note vault every score rounds to zero and the ranking tells
you nothing.
