"""`quipu ask-backfill` — give entries the question they answer, so the corpus can become training data (#27).

`ask` is what turns a memory into a trainable pair: the question a searcher would have asked, paired with
the entry's summary/evidence as the answer. Without it an entry is recall only. On this vault 17 of 864
entries had one, which is why `quipu export` produced 18 SFT examples.

This is the one place quipu calls a model, and it is deliberately the narrowest possible call:

- **One question per entry.** ~40 output tokens, no chain, no tools, temperature 0.
- **Any OpenAI-compatible endpoint**, so it runs against the free on-box tier or a cloud key without the
  package gaining a dependency.
- **Every answer is validated before it is stored.** It must be a single line ending in `?`, it must not
  be a restatement of the summary, and it must be 12..200 bytes. A model that returns prose, a quote, or
  an empty string costs that entry and nothing else — the entry keeps its place, reported as skipped.
- **Dry run by default.** `--apply` writes the `ask:` line in place, like `quipu repair`; nothing is
  renamed and the body is not touched.

The judgement that cannot be automated: whether the question is the one a *human* would ask. That is why
`--sample N` prints the proposed pairs for review before a whole-corpus run.
