"""`quipu hook` — the session-end entry point a framework calls, without embedding quipu (#3).

A memory system that nobody calls gathers nothing, and a hook that fails quietly is worse than no hook:
the session ends, the framework says "memory: ok", and nothing was written. This module is the one place
that trade is decided, so every failure path raises or exits non-zero, and a hung endpoint cannot hold
the session open:

- `run()` does capture -> reflect -> apply in that order, writing only after the model returned, so a
  transport error leaves the vault untouched rather than half-written;
- the reflection call is bounded by `timeout` (default 300 s) on a worker thread, because a blocking
  `urlopen` has no deadline of its own once it is inside a framework's shutdown path;
- `dry_run` (or `QUIPU_HOOK_DRY_RUN=1`) returns the exact prompt and writes nothing, which is how a
  human checks the hook without spending tokens.

The transcript is a path to the session file (Hermes JSONL or plain markdown) or `-` for stdin.
